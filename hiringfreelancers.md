## I'm hiring freelancers

### Why is Freelancer Protocol useful for me?

{:toc}

For two main reasons:

- **gradually commit and control risk**  
  Freelancer projects get expensive, and it's usually risky to pay in one or two times. We enable you to break the project down into several smaller milestones.
- **get your work on time**  
  No more late deliverables. You're free to cancel the project if the freelancer hasn't uploaded anything by the deadline. You can also change the scope of the project, for exemple to charge late fees (freelancer will need to accept the new terms).

Note we can only investigate if the deliverable was accurately described to start with.

⚠️ Only accept milestones that accurately describe what the deliverable should be, through the description and attachements.

We reserve the full right to exclude freelancer whose deliverable consistently get reported and differ from their description.

<!-- > In the same way, a freelancer who uploads misleading demos of deliverables also faces exclusion. -->

<!-- We can only investigate a complaint if the milestone was properly describe to start with.

To help us look into complaints, please make sure
When you do, we'll investigate and reserve the right to exclude any freelancer that consistently upload deliverables like this.

We can only take measure.
