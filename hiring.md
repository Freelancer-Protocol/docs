## For clients

### Why is Freelancer Protocol useful for me?

**Control the risk by committing gradually**  
 Freelancer projects get expensive, and it's usually risky to pay in one or two times. We enable you to break the project down into several smaller milestones.

**Have your tasks delivered on time**  
 You're free to cancel the project and get your money back if the freelancer hasn't uploaded anything by the deadline. You can also change the scope of the project, for exemple to charge late fees (freelancer will need to accept your new terms).

### Do I get a refund if I'm not happy with the deliverable?

No, that's why it is important to be aware of the following guidelines:

⚠️ You never commit more that the amount of the current milestone, so start with small milestones if it's your first time working with a freelancer.

If you're unhappy with a deliverable, you do have the option to 'report this deliverable', and we'll look into it.
Note we can only investigate if the deliverable was accurately described to start with, so:

⚠️ Only accept milestones that accurately describe what the deliverable should be, through the description and attachements.

We reserve the full right to exclude any freelancer whose deliverable consistently get reported and differ from their description.

### I don't have a freelancer. Can you help me find one?

We can try! We interact with different types of freelancers on a daily basis, so send us an email at hello@freelancerprotocol.com and we'll try do our best.

### Do you store my credit card information?

No. We use Stripe for payments and your payment info is never stored on our servers.
