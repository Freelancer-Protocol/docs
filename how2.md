### How do payments get made?

Clients get charged and freelancers get paid throughout a project.

1. We charge the client at the start of each milestone.
2. Funds get transfered to the freelancer when they upload the deliverable.
3. We refund the client in full if the freelancer hasn't uploaded the deliverable by the deadline.

### Why this mechanism?

1. To enable gradual commitment (of time for the freelancer and money for the client)
2. So that the freelancer is paid on time and with 100% certainty
3. So that the client is free to cancel a late project
