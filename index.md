## Why do I need this?

### 💵 Say goodbye to fees

Platforms usually charge a fee that ranges between 10% and 15% to match people together. As that's a real service it makes sense to pay the price for it, at least for the first months of the relationship.

However, it stops making sense when the parties have known each other for a while or have met outside the platform. They usually try to have a direct relationship and it usually is a mess.

### ⛑ Increased reliability

<!-- 🔒 -->

##### From client perspective

The risk of the freelancer delivering late or not at all is gone. You don't pay the bulk of the money unless you accept a demo of the working deliverable first.

##### From freelancer perspective

The risk of the client paying late or not at all is gone. Client doesn't receive anything unless you're paid in full.

<!-- ##### For both parties -->

### 📜 Reduced legal hassle

Each milestone is covered by a contract and we generate invoices.

### 🛠 Your new favorite project management tool

<!-- ☀️🖥🔦 -->

Dividing a single project into multiple milestones enables better planning and visibility. It also allows for a more gradual investment (of time for the freelancer and money for the client).

We're putting UX first to make Freelancer Protocol a pleasant tool to manage projects on.
