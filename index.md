## Why do I need this?

### Say goodbye to fees

Platforms usually charge between 10% and 15% fee to match people together. It's a real service, and makes sense to pay the price for the first months of the relationship.

However, it stops making sense when the parties have known each other for a while or have met outside the platform. So they then try to take the relationship directly and it usually is a mess.

### Increased reliability

**From a client perspective**

the risk of the freelancer delivering late or not at all is gone.
