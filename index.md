## Why do I need this?

### 💵 Say goodbye to fees

Platforms usually charge between 10% and 15% fee to match people together. It's a real service, and makes sense to pay the price for the first months of the relationship.

However, it stops making sense when the parties have known each other for a while or have met outside the platform. They usually try to have a direct relationship and it usually is a mess.

### ⛑ Increased reliability

<!-- 🔒 -->

##### From a client perspective

The risk of the freelancer delivering late or not at all is gone. You don't pay the bulk of the money unless you accept a demo of the working deliverable first.

##### From a freelancer perspective

The risk of the client paying late or not at all is gone. The client doesn't receive anything unless you're paid in full.

##### For both parties

Dividing a single project into multiple milestones with explicit description enables better planning and visibility. It allows and a more gradual investment (of time for the freelancer and money for the client).

### 📜 Reduced legal hassle

Each milestone is covered by a contract and we generate invoices.

### 🛠 A pleasant project management tool

<!-- ☀️🖥🔦 -->

We're putting UX first to make Freelancer Protocol a great tool to manage projects on.
