## How it works

### Projects and Milestones

A project has a single client and a single freelancer, and is divided into milestones. Each milestones has its own associated deliverable, price and deadline.

 <!-- The project is divided into one or more milestones.
Each milestone  -->

### Lifecyle of a milestone

1. A milestone start when both parties agree on its terms. The client is charged right away by the platform.

> For this reason, the milestone can't start until the client has entered their payment info.

Both parties can request to change the milestone before the deadline. The changes will have to be accepted by the other party in order to become effective.

2. The freelancer has to upload _both_ a demo video and the deliverable before the milestone deadline.

3. If the client accepts the demo, he receives the deliverable and the freelancer receives the money.

## If things go south

### 1. The client rejects the demo

Only a third of the agreed sum for the milestone is paid to the freelancer. The rest will is paid back to the client.

> ⚠️ A client that constantly rejects demos that follow their own instructions (outlined in the milestone description and enclosed designs) is facing exclusion from the platform.

> ⚠️ In the same way, a freelancer that uploads misleading demos of deliverables also faces exclusion.

### 2. The freelancer is late

If both the demo and the deliverable are not uploaded by the milestone deadline, the client is free to either:

- cancel the milestone and get the entire sum back
- request a m
- extend the milestone by assigning it a new deadline, (and can charge late fees by changing the agreed amount)
