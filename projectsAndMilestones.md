## Projects and Milestones

### What they are

A project has a single client and a signle freelancer, and is divided into milestones. Each milestones has its own associated deliverable, price and deadline.

 <!-- The project is divided into one or more milestones.
Each milestone  -->

### Lifecyle of a milestone

1. A milestone start when both parties agree on terms. The client is charged right away by the platform.

2. The freelancer has to upload both a demo video and the deliverable before the milestone deadline.

3. If the client accepts the demo, he received the deliverable and the freelancer receives the money.

## If things go south

### 1. The client rejects the demo

If the client rejects the demo for a given milestone, only a third of the agreed sum will be paid to the freelancer. The rest will be paid back to the client.

A client that constantly rejects demos that follow the guidelines given in the milestones description and enclosed designs is facing exclusion from the platform.

In the same way, a freelancer that uploads misleading demos of deliverables also faces exclusion.

### 2. The freelancer is late

If both the demo and the deliverable are not uploaded by the milestone deadline, the client can cancel the milestone and get the entire sum back.

The client can also, if they wish, extend the milestone by assigning it a new deadline, and has the full discretion to charge late fees by changing the agreed amount.
