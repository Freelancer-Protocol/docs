## Projects and Milestones

### What they are

A project has a single client and a single freelancer, and is divided into milestones. Each milestones has its own associated deliverable, price and deadline.

 <!-- The project is divided into one or more milestones.
Each milestone  -->

### Lifecyle of a milestone

1. A milestone start when both parties agree on its terms. The client is charged right away by the platform.

> For this reason, the milestone can't start until the client has entered their payment info.

2. The freelancer has to upload _both_ a demo video and the deliverable before the milestone deadline.

3. If the client accepts the demo, he received the deliverable and the freelancer receives the money.

## If things go south

### 1. The client rejects the demo

If the client rejects the demo for a given milestone, only a third of the agreed sum will be paid to the freelancer. The rest will be paid back to the client.

> ⚠️ A client that constantly rejects demos that follow the guidelines given in the milestones description and enclosed designs is facing exclusion from the platform.

> ⚠️ In the same way, a freelancer that uploads misleading demos of deliverables also faces exclusion.

### 2. The freelancer is late

If both the demo and the deliverable are not uploaded by the milestone deadline, the client is free to either:

- cancel the milestone and get the entire sum back
- extend the milestone by assigning it a new deadline, (and can charge late fees by changing the agreed amount.)
