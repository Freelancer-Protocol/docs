## How it works

### What are projects and milestones?

A project is between a single freelancer and client, and is divided into intermediary steps we call milestones.  
Each milestones has a **deliverable** (the work the freelancer has to submit), a **deadline** (when they have to submit it for) and a **price** (how much they will get for it).

ðŸ‘‰ Milestones take place once after the other within a project and cannot overlap.

### Can I cancel or edit a milestone?

Both parties can cancel milestones before they start. A freelancer can override a project that hasn't been accepted yet.
If it has been accepted, the freelancer has to send a request for change his client will have to accept.

### How do payments get made?

Clients get charged and freelancers get paid throughout a project.

1. We charge the client at the start of each milestone.
2. Funds get transfered to the freelancer when they upload the deliverable.
3. We refund the client in full if the freelancer hasn't uploaded the deliverable by the deadline.

### Why this mechanism?

1. To enable gradual commitment (of time for the freelancer and money for the client)
2. So that the freelancer is paid on time and with 100% certainty
3. So that the client is free to cancel a late project

<!-- ### Why do you hold funds?

Only way to guaranty:

-

It enables gradual commitment on both sides. At any given point, both parties are only committed as far as the current milestone goes,

Just risking as much as the current ongoing milestone. Each side is only committed as far.
Client and freelancer do not -->
