## A concrete example

**Lisa is a freelancer and Steve is her client.** Steve needs Lisa to build him a brand new website.

<!-- Neither want to go through a platform that will charge expensive fees, so Lisa signs up to [Freelancer Protocol](https://www.freelancerprotocol.com/) as a freelancer.

 <div class ="example-image small">
  <img src="/images/freelancerSignUp.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div> -->

**Lisa creates a project:** she names it _Steve's website_ and sets _steve@gmail.com_ as the client email.

 <div class ="example-image small">
  <img src="/images/NewProject.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

 <!-- <div class ="example-image medium">
  <img src="/images/ProjectCategory.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div> -->

**She populates the project with a milestone** titled _Homepage_. She fills the _Due date_ and _Price_ fields, suggesting respectively a week from now and £250.

Note she leaves the _Deliverable description_ field blank for Steve to fill.

 <div class ="example-image big">
  <img src="/images/LisasDraft.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

Lisa now previews the milestone.

 <div class ="example-image medium400">
  <img src="/images/LisasPreview.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

She sends it by clicking on <span class="button blue-gradient" style="width: 140px"> Accept and Send</span>

If Steve has not already signed up to Freelancer Protocol, he'll be sent an invite to join. If he already is a user, he'll receive an email along with a notification:

 <div class ="example-image medium400">
  <img src="/images/StevesEmail.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

 <div class ="example-image tiny">
  <img src="/images/StevesNotification.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

This is what the _Homepage_ milestone looks like to Steve at this point:

 <div class ="example-image big">
  <img src="/images/StevesReceives.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

Steve chooses to <span class="button secondary-green" style="width: 195px"> Accept with Modification</span>

That way he is able to fill in the _Deliverable description_.

 <div class ="example-image big">
  <img src="/images/StevesModification.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

When he previews the milestone, Steve is warned he **needs to enter his payment info for the milestone to be able to start**, so he does just that.

 <div class ="example-image tiny">
  <img src="/images/StevesWarning.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

Now Lisa will has to approve of the edited milestone. This is what the project looks like from Steve and Lisa's respective dasboards.

 <div class ="two-cards">
    <div class ="example-image tiny-small">
    <img src="/images/StevesCard.png" alt="accessibility text" >
    </div>
    <div class ="example-image tiny-small">
    <img src="/images/LisasCard.png" alt="accessibility text" >
    </div>
</div>

**Lisa accepts the edited milestone.** Freelancer Protocol deducts the full £250 from Steve, and both parties receive an email and a notification. This is what the dashboard and milestone status now look like for Steve and Lisa:

 <div class ="two-cards">
    <div class ="example-image tiny-small">
    <img src="/images/MilestoneOngoing1.png" alt="accessibility text" >
    </div>
    <div class ="example-image tiny-small">
    <img src="/images/MilestoneOngoing2.png" alt="accessibility text" >
    </div>
</div>

**Lisa now has to upload a demo.** It only takes Lisa 3 days to make a static version of the website that's good enough for a demo, so she submits it.

 <div class ="example-image small">
  <img src="/images/DemoUpload.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

Steve is now asked to either approve or reject the demo:

 <div class ="example-image tiny-small">
  <img src="/images/StevesDemoApproval.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

Steve likes what he's seeing so he approves the demo. **It's normal that the demo has a few minor glitches Steve would like to see handled for the final stage.**

The milestone will now finalize for sure, as soon as Lisa uploads the deliverable.

When she does, Freelancer Protocol will send Lisa the funds, and Steve will receive the deliverable.

This milestone is completed, on to the next one!
