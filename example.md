## A concrete example

Lisa is a freelancer and Steve is her client. Steve wants to have Lisa build a brand new website.

Neither want to go through a platform that will charge expensive fees, so Lisa signs up to [Freelancer Protocol](https://www.freelancerprotocol.com/) as a freelancer.

 <div class ="example-image small">
  <img src="/images/freelancerSignUp.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

She creates a project she names _Steve's website_ and sets _steve@gmail.com_ as the client email.

 <div class ="example-image tiny">
  <img src="/images/NewProject.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

 <div class ="example-image medium">
  <img src="/images/ProjectCategory.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

She creates draft for a milestone titled _Homepage_. She prepopulates the due date and price fields, suggesting respectively a week from now and \$250.

 <div class ="example-image big">
  <img src="/images/LisasDraft.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

Lisa now shares the project with the draft milestone in it.

Steve is pinged by email, and taken directly to the project after he signs up as a client.

 <div class ="example-image medium">
  <img src="/images/StevesEmail.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

He enters his payment info (client need to for the milestone to start) and details his specs for the homepage.
He then previews the milestone before sending it.

 <div class ="example-image medium-big">
  <img src="/images/StevesPreview.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

That's what the project now looks like from Steve and Lisa's respective dashboard.

 <div class ="two-cards">
    <div class ="example-image tiny-small">
    <img src="/images/StevesCard.png" alt="accessibility text" >
    </div>
    <div class ="example-image tiny-small">
    <img src="/images/LisasCard1.png" alt="accessibility text" >
    </div>
</div>

Lisa accepts can now accept the milestone.

 <div class ="example-image big">
  <img src="/images/LisasApproval.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

Milestone has now started! Freelancer Protocol deducts the full \$250 from Steve.
They both get an email and a notification on their dashboards.

 <div class ="example-image small">
  <img src="/images/LisasNotifications.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

<!-- All the above may sound super long but it reality the whole should take Steve and Lisa about 5 minutes each. -->

It only takes Lisa 3 days to make a static version of the website that's good enough for a demo, so she submits it.

 <div class ="example-image small">
  <img src="/images/DemoUpload.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

Steve likes what he's seeing so he approves the demo. The milestone will now finalize for sure, as soon as Lisa uploads the deliverable.

When she does, Freelancer Protocol will send Lisa the funds, and Steve will receive the deliverable.

 <div class ="example-image tiny">
  <img src="/images/Download.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

The milestone is now finished, on to the next one!
