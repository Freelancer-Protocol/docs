## A concrete example

Lisa is a freelancer and Steve is her client. Steve needs Lisa to build him a brand new website.

<!-- Neither want to go through a platform that will charge expensive fees, so Lisa signs up to [Freelancer Protocol](https://www.freelancerprotocol.com/) as a freelancer.

 <div class ="example-image small">
  <img src="/images/freelancerSignUp.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div> -->

Lisa creates a project: she names it _Steve's website_ and sets _steve@gmail.com_ as the client email.

 <div class ="example-image small">
  <img src="/images/NewProject.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

 <!-- <div class ="example-image medium">
  <img src="/images/ProjectCategory.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div> -->

She populates the project with a milestone titled _Homepage_. She fills the **Due date** and **Price** fields, suggesting respectively a week from now and \£250.

Note she leaves the **Deliverable description** field blank, so that Steve can fill it.

 <div class ="example-image big">
  <img src="/images/LisasDraft.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

Lisa now previews and sends by clicking on <span class="button blue-gradient" style="width: 140px"> Accept and Send</span>

If Steve has not already signed up to Freelancer Protocol, he'll be sent an invite to join. If he already is a user, he'll receive a simple email:

 <div class ="example-image medium400">
  <img src="/images/StevesEmail.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

 <div class ="example-image big">
  <img src="/images/StevesReceives.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

Steve chooses to <span class="button secondary-green" style="width: 195px"> Accept with Modification</span>

That way he is able to fill in **Deliverable description**. This means Lisa will have to approve of the editted description before sending it.

 <div class ="example-image big">
  <img src="/images/StevesModification.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

When he previews the milestone, Steve is warned he needs to enter his payment info for the milestone to be able to start, so he does just that.

 <div class ="example-image big">
  <img src="/images/StevesWarning.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

<!-- He enters his payment info (client need to for the milestone to start) and details his specs for the homepage.
He then previews the milestone before sending it. -->

So now that it's Lisa turn to **Accept** the milestone, this is what the project looks like from their respective dasboards.

 <div class ="two-cards">
    <div class ="example-image tiny-small">
    <img src="/images/StevesCard.png" alt="accessibility text" >
    </div>
    <div class ="example-image tiny-small">
    <img src="/images/LisasCard.png" alt="accessibility text" >
    </div>
</div>

Lisa accepts now accepts the milestone. **Freelancer Protocol** deducts the full \£250 from Steve, and both parties receive an email and a notification.

 <div class ="two-cards">
    <div class ="example-image tiny-small">
    <img src="/images/MilestoneOngoing1.png" alt="accessibility text" >
    </div>
    <div class ="example-image tiny-small">
    <img src="/images/MilestoneOngoing2.png" alt="accessibility text" >
    </div>
</div>

 <!-- <div class ="example-image big">
  <img src="/images/LisasApproval.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

Milestone has now started! Freelancer Protocol deducts the full \£250 from Steve.
They both get an email and a notification on their dashboards.

 <div class ="example-image small">
  <img src="/images/LisasNotifications.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div> -->

<!-- All the above may sound super long but it reality the whole should take Steve and Lisa about 5 minutes each. -->

It only takes Lisa 3 days to make a static version of the website that's good enough for a demo, so she submits it.

 <div class ="example-image small">
  <img src="/images/DemoUpload.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

Steve likes what he's seeing so he approves the demo. The milestone will now finalize for sure, as soon as Lisa uploads the deliverable.

When she does, Freelancer Protocol will send Lisa the funds, and Steve will receive the deliverable.

 <!-- <div class ="example-image tiny">
  <img src="/images/Download.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div> -->

The milestone is now finished, on to the next one!
