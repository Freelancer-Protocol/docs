## A concrete example

Lisa is a freelancer and Steve is her client. Steve wants to have Lisa build a brand new website.

Neither want to go through a platform that will charge expensive fees, so Lisa signs up to [Freelancer Protocol](https://www.freelancerprotocol.com/) as a freelancer.

 <div class ="example-image small">
  <img src="/images/freelancerSignUp.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

She creates a project she names _Steve's website_ and sets _steve@gmail.com_ as the client email.

 <div class ="example-image tiny">
  <img src="/images/NewProject.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

 <div class ="example-image medium">
  <img src="/images/ProjectCategory.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

She creates draft for a milestone titled _Homepage_. She prepopulates the due date and price fields, suggesting respectively a week from now and \$250.

 <div class ="example-image big">
  <img src="/images/LisasDraft.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

Lisa now shares the project with the draft milestone in it.

Steve is pinged by email, and taken directly to the project after he signs up as a client.

 <div class ="example-image medium">
  <img src="/images/StevesEmail.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

He enters his payment info (client need to for the milestone to start) and details his specs for the homepage.
He then previews the milestone before sending it.

 <div class ="example-image medium-big">
  <img src="/images/StevesPreview.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

That's what the project looks like from Steve's dashboard.

 <!-- <div class ="example-image tiny-small">
  <img src="/images/StevesCard.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div> -->

Lisa accepts now accepts the milestone.

 <div class ="example-image big">
  <img src="/images/LisasApproval.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

Milestone has now started! Freelancer Protocol deducts the full \$250 from Steve.
They both get an email and a notification on their dashboards.

 <div class ="example-image tiny-small">
  <img src="/images/LisasNotifications.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

<!-- All the above may sound super long but it reality the whole should take Steve and Lisa about 5 minutes each. -->

It takes just 3 days to make a static version of the website that's good enough for a demo. She submits it.

<!-- Steve finds the  -->

9 days later, Lisa uploads both the demo and the deliverable to Freelancer Protocol.
Steve received the demo. It looks rather good, so he accepts it.

When he does, two things happen:

- Freelancer protocol sends Lisa the money
- Steve receives the deliverable

The milestone is closed ! On to a next one.
