## A concrete example

**Lisa is a freelancer and Steve is her client.** Steve needs Lisa to build him a brand new website.

<!-- Neither want to go through a platform that will charge expensive fees, so Lisa signs up to [Freelancer Protocol](https://www.freelancerprotocol.com/) as a freelancer.

 <div class ="example-image small">
  <img src="/images/freelancerSignUp.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div> -->

**Lisa creates a project:** she names it _Steve's website_ and sets _steve@gmail.com_ as the client email.

 <div class ="example-image small">
  <img src="/images/NewProject.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

 <!-- <div class ="example-image medium">
  <img src="/images/ProjectCategory.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div> -->

**She populates the project with a milestone** titled _Homepage_. She fills the _Due date_ and _Price_ fields, suggesting respectively a week from now and £250.

Note she leaves the _Deliverable description_ field blank for Steve to fill.

 <div class ="example-image big">
  <img src="/images/LisasDraft.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

Lisa previews the milestone:

 <div class ="example-image medium400">
  <img src="/images/LisasPreview.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

She sends it to Steve by clicking on <span class="button blue-gradient" > Accept and Send</span>

If Steve has not already signed up to Freelancer Protocol, he'll be sent an invite to join. If he already is a user, he'll receive an email along with a notification:

 <div class ="example-image medium400">
  <img src="/images/StevesEmail.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

 <div class ="example-image tiny long">
  <img src="/images/StevesNotification.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

This is what the _Homepage_ milestone looks like to Steve at this point:

 <div class ="example-image big">
  <img src="/images/StevesReceives.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

Steve chooses to <span class="button secondary-green" > Accept with Modification</span> so that he can write the _Deliverable description_.

 <div class ="example-image big">
  <img src="/images/StevesModification.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

When he previews the milestone, Steve is warned he needs to **enter his payment info for the milestone to be able to start**, so he does just that.

 <div class ="example-image tiny long">
  <img src="/images/StevesWarning.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

Now Lisa will has to approve of the edited milestone. This is what the project looks like from Steve and Lisa's respective dasboards.

 <div class ="two-cards">

  <div class ="example-image tiny-small">
    <img src="/images/LisasCard.png" alt="accessibility text" >
  </div>
  <div class ="example-image tiny-small">
    <img src="/images/StevesCard.png" alt="accessibility text" >
  </div>
  
</div>

**Lisa accepts the edited milestone.** Freelancer Protocol deducts the full £250 from Steve, and both parties receive an email and a notification. This is what the dashboard and milestone status now look like for Steve and Lisa:

 <div class ="two-cards">
    <div class ="example-image tiny-small">
    <img src="/images/MilestoneOngoing1.png" alt="accessibility text" >
    </div>
    <div class ="example-image tiny-small">
    <img src="/images/MilestoneOngoing2.png" alt="accessibility text" >
    </div>
</div>

**Lisa now has to upload a demo.** It only takes Lisa 3 days to make a static version of the website that's good enough for a demo, so she submits it.

 <div class ="example-image tiny-small">
  <img src="/images/DemoUpload.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

Steve is now asked to either approve or reject the demo:

 <div class ="example-image small long">
  <img src="/images/StevesDemoApproval.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

**It's ok for the demo to have a few minor glitches that will have to be fixed for the final version.**
Steve likes what he's seeing so he approves the demo.

The milestone will now finalize for sure, as soon as Lisa uploads the deliverable.

When she does, **Lisa will receive the funds, and Steve will receive the deliverable**.

**This milestone is completed**, on to the next one!
