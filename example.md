## A concrete example

**Lisa is a freelancer and Steve is her client.** Steve needs Lisa to build him a brand new website.

<!-- Neither want to go through a platform that will charge expensive fees, so Lisa signs up to [Freelancer Protocol](https://www.freelancerprotocol.com/) as a freelancer.

 <div class ="example-image small">
  <img src="/images/freelancerSignUp.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div> -->

**Lisa creates a project:** she names it _Steve's website_ and sets _steve@gmail.com_ as the client email.

 <div class ="example-image small">
  <img src="/images/NewProject.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

 <!-- <div class ="example-image medium">
  <img src="/images/ProjectCategory.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div> -->

**She populates the project with a milestone** titled _Homepage_. She fills the _Due date_ and _Price_ fields, suggesting respectively a week from now and £250.

Note she leaves the _Deliverable description_ field blank, so that Steve can fill it.

 <div class ="example-image big">
  <img src="/images/LisasDraft.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

Lisa now previews the milestone.

 <div class ="example-image medium400">
  <img src="/images/LisasPreview.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

She sends it by clicking on <span class="button blue-gradient" style="width: 140px"> Accept and Send</span>

If Steve has not already signed up to Freelancer Protocol, he'll be sent an invite to join. If he already is a user, he'll receive a simple email:

 <div class ="example-image medium400">
  <img src="/images/StevesEmail.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

 <div class ="example-image big">
  <img src="/images/StevesReceives.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

Steve chooses to <span class="button secondary-green" style="width: 195px"> Accept with Modification</span>

That way he is able to fill in the _Deliverable description_.

 <div class ="example-image big">
  <img src="/images/StevesModification.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

When he previews the milestone, Steve is warned he **needs to enter his payment info for the milestone to be able to start**, so he does just that.

 <div class ="example-image tiny">
  <img src="/images/StevesWarning.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

Now Lisa will has to approve of the editted milestone. This is what the project looks like from Steve and Lisa's respective dasboards.

 <div class ="two-cards">
    <div class ="example-image tiny-small">
    <img src="/images/StevesCard.png" alt="accessibility text" >
    </div>
    <div class ="example-image tiny-small">
    <img src="/images/LisasCard.png" alt="accessibility text" >
    </div>
</div>

**Lisa accepts the editted milestone.** Freelancer Protocol deducts the full £250 from Steve, and both parties receive an email and a notification. This is what the dashboard and milestone status now look like for Steve and Lisa:

 <div class ="two-cards">
    <div class ="example-image tiny-small">
    <img src="/images/MilestoneOngoing1.png" alt="accessibility text" >
    </div>
    <div class ="example-image tiny-small">
    <img src="/images/MilestoneOngoing2.png" alt="accessibility text" >
    </div>
</div>

 <!-- <div class ="example-image big">
  <img src="/images/LisasApproval.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

Milestone has now started! Freelancer Protocol deducts the full \£250 from Steve.
They both get an email and a notification on their dashboards.

 <div class ="example-image small">
  <img src="/images/LisasNotifications.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div> -->

<!-- All the above may sound super long but it reality the whole should take Steve and Lisa about 5 minutes each. -->

**Lisa now has to upload a demo.** It only takes Lisa 3 days to make a static version of the website that's good enough for a demo, so she submits it.

 <div class ="example-image small">
  <img src="/images/DemoUpload.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div>

Steve likes what he's seeing so he approves the demo. **It's normal if the demo has a few minor glitches and things Steve would like to see adjusted for the final stage.**

The milestone will now finalize for sure, as soon as Lisa uploads the deliverable.

When she does, Freelancer Protocol will send Lisa the funds, and Steve will receive the deliverable.

 <!-- <div class ="example-image tiny">
  <img src="/images/Download.png" alt="accessibility text" >
</div> -->

The milestone is now finished, on to the next one!
