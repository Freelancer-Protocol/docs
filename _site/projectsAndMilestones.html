<h3 id="what-they-are">What they are</h3>

<p>A project has a single client and a single freelancer, and is divided into milestones. Each milestones has its own associated deliverable, price and deadline.</p>

<p><!-- The project is divided into one or more milestones.
Each milestone  --></p>

<h3 id="lifecyle-of-a-milestone">Lifecyle of a milestone</h3>

<ol>
  <li>A milestone start when both parties agree on its terms. The client is charged right away by the platform.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>For this reason, the milestone can’t start until the client has entered their payment info.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The freelancer has to upload both a demo video and the deliverable before the milestone deadline.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the client accepts the demo, he received the deliverable and the freelancer receives the money.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="1-the-client-rejects-the-demo">1. The client rejects the demo</h3>

<p>If the client rejects the demo for a given milestone, only a third of the agreed sum will be paid to the freelancer. The rest will be paid back to the client.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>⚠️ A client that constantly rejects demos that follow the guidelines given in the milestones description and enclosed designs is facing exclusion from the platform.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>⚠️ In the same way, a freelancer that uploads misleading demos of deliverables also faces exclusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="2-the-freelancer-is-late">2. The freelancer is late</h3>

<p>If both the demo and the deliverable are not uploaded by the milestone deadline, the client can cancel the milestone and get the entire sum back.</p>

<p>The client can also, if they wish, extend the milestone by assigning it a new deadline, and has the full discretion to charge late fees by changing the agreed amount.</p>
