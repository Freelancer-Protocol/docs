<h3 id="projects-and-milestones">Projects and Milestones</h3>

<p>A project is has one client and one freelancer, and is divided into milestones. Each milestones has its own associated deliverable, price and deadline.</p>

<p><!-- The project is divided into one or more milestones.
Each milestone  --></p>

<h3 id="lifecyle-of-a-milestone">Lifecyle of a milestone</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A milestone start when both parties agree on its terms. The client is charged right away by the platform.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>üëâ For this reason, the milestone can‚Äôt start until the client has entered their payment info.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The freelancer has to upload <em>both</em> a demo (either a link or video) and the deliverable before the milestone deadline.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the client accepts the demo, he receives the deliverable and the freelancer receives the money.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Note that during a milestone lifetime, anyone of the two parties can request a modification to the milestone. The changes will have to be accepted by the other party in order to become effective.</p>

<h3 id="1-if-the-client-rejects-the-demo">1. If the client rejects the demo</h3>

<p>Only a third of the agreed sum for the milestone is paid to the freelancer. The rest is paid back to the client.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ö†Ô∏è A client that constantly rejects demos that follow their own instructions (outlined in the milestone description and enclosed designs) is facing exclusion from the platform.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ö†Ô∏è In the same way, a freelancer that uploads misleading demos of deliverables also faces exclusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="2-if-the-freelancer-is-late">2. If the freelancer is late</h3>

<p>If both the demo and the deliverable are not uploaded by the milestone deadline, the client is free to either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cancel the milestone and get the entire sum back</li>
  <li>
    <p>extend the milestone by assigning it a new deadline</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>‚è± The client can charge late fees by changing the milestone amount, but the freelancer will have to agree to those new terms.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>
