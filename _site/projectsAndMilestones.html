    <p>A milestone start when both parties agree on terms. The client is charged right away by the platform.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The freelancer has to upload both a demo video and the deliverable before the milestone deadline.</p>
  </li>

<h3 id="1-if-the-client-rejects-the-demo">1. If the client rejects the demo</h3>

<p>If the client rejects the demo for a given milestone, only a third of the agreed sum will be paid to the freelancer. The rest will be paid back to the client.</p>

<p>A client that constantly rejects demos that follow the guidelines given in the milestones description and enclosed designs is facing exclusion from the platform.</p>

<p>In the same way, a freelancer that uploads misleading demos of deliverables also faces exclusion.</p>

<h3 id="2-the-freelancer-is-late">2. The freelancer is late</h3>

<p>If both the demo and the deliverable are not uploaded by the milestone deadline, the client can cancel the milestone and get the entire sum back.</p>

<p>The client can also, if they wish, extend the milestone by assigning it a new deadline, and has the full discretion to charge late fees by changing the agreed amount.</p>
