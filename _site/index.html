<p>Platforms usually charge between 10% and 15% fee to match people together. It’s a real service, and makes sense to pay the price for the first months of the relationship.
It stops making sense when the parties have known each other for a while or have met outside the platform.
So they then try to take the relationship directly and it usually is a mess.</p>
