<p>Platforms usually charge between 10% and 15% fee to match people together. It’s a real service, and makes sense to pay the price for the first months of the relationship.</p>

<p>However, it stops making sense when the parties have known each other for a while or have met outside the platform. They usually try to have a direct relationship and it usually is a mess.</p>

<p>The risk of the freelancer delivering late or not at all is gone. You don’t pay the bulk of the money unless you accept a demo of the working deliverable first.</p>

<p>Dividing a single project into multiple milestones with explicit description enables better planning, visibility and a more gradual investment (of time for the freelancer and money for the client).</p>

<p>Each milestone is covered by a contract and we generate invoices.</p>
