<h2 id="a-concrete-example">A concrete example</h2>

<p>Lisa is a freelancer and Steve is her client. Steve wants to have Lisa build a brand new website.</p>

<p>Neither want to go through a platform that will charge expensive fees, so Lisa signs up to <a href="https://www.freelancerprotocol.com/">Freelancer Protocol</a> as a freelancer.</p>

<div class="example-image small">
  <img src="/images/freelancerSignUp.png" alt="accessibility text" />
</div>

<p>She creates a project she names <em>Steve’s website</em> and sets <em>steve@gmail.com</em> as the client email.</p>

<div class="example-image tiny">
  <img src="/images/NewProject.png" alt="accessibility text" />
</div>

<div class="example-image medium">
  <img src="/images/ProjectCategory.png" alt="accessibility text" />
</div>

<p>She creates draft for a milestone titled <em>Homepage</em>. She prepopulates the due date and price fields, suggesting respectively a week from now and $250.</p>

<div class="example-image big">
  <img src="/images/LisasDraft.png" alt="accessibility text" />
</div>

<p>Lisa now shares the project with the draft milestone in it.</p>

<p>Steve is pinged by email, and taken directly to the project after he signs up as a client.</p>

<div class="example-image medium">
  <img src="/images/StevesEmail.png" alt="accessibility text" />
</div>

<p>He enters his payment info (client need to for the milestone to start) and details his specs for the homepage.
He then previews the milestone before sending it.</p>

  <img src="/images/StevesPreview.png" alt="accessibility text" />
</div>

<p>That’s what the project now looks like from Steve and Lisa’s respective dashboard.</p>

<div class="two-cards">

    <img src="/images/StevesCard.png" alt="accessibility text" />
    </div>
    <div class="example-image tiny-small">
    <img src="/images/LisasCard1.png" alt="accessibility text" />
    </div>
</div>

<p>Lisa accepts can now accept the milestone.</p>

<div class="example-image big">
  <img src="/images/LisasApproval.png" alt="accessibility text" />
</div>

<p>Milestone has now started! Freelancer Protocol deducts the full $250 from Steve.
They both get an email and a notification on their dashboards.</p>

<!-- All the above may sound super long but it reality the whole should take Steve and Lisa about 5 minutes each. -->

<p>It only takes Lisa 3 days to make a static version of the website that’s good enough for a demo, so she submits it.</p>

<p>Steve likes what he’s seeing so he approves the demo. The milestone will now finalize for sure, as soon as Lisa uploads the deliverable.</p>

<p>When she does, Freelancer Protocol will send Lisa the funds, and Steve will receive the deliverable.</p>

<p>The milestone is now finished, on to the next one!</p>

<p><strong>See <a href="https://docs.freelancerprotocol.com/how.html#if-things-go-south">this section</a> what happens if Steve rejects the demo or if Lisa doesn’t upload the deliverable by the deadline.</strong></p>
