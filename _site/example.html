<p>She creates a project called <em>Steve’s website</em> and sets steve@gmail.com as the client email.
She could redact the milestone then send it to him, but today she chooses to share the project so he can create the milestone himself.</p>

<p>Steve is pinged by email, and taken directly to the project when he signs up as a client. He adds a milestone called “Homepage”. He believes it’s a good start to his website project and inserts 10 days as a deadline.</p>

<p>He previews then sends the milestone.</p>
