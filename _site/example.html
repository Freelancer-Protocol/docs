<p>Lisa is a freelancer and Steve is her client. Steve wants to have Lisa build a brand new website.</p>

<p>Neither want to go through a platform that will charge expensive fees, so Lisa signs up to <a href="https://www.freelancerprotocol.com/">Freelancer Protocol</a> as a freelancer.</p>

<p>She creates a project she names <em>Steveâ€™s website</em> and sets <em>steve@gmail.com</em> as the client email.
She creates draft for a milestone titles <em>Homepage</em>. She prepopulates the due date and price fields, suggesting respectively a week from now and $250.</p>

<p>Lisa now shares the project with the draft milestone in it.</p>

<p>Steve is pinged by email, and taken directly to the project after he signs up as a client.</p>

<p>He enters his payment info (client need to before a milestone can start), he details his specs for the homepage.
He then previews the milestone then sends it.</p>

<p>Lisa accepts it, the milestone has started! Freelancer Protocol deducts the full $250 from Steve.</p>

<!-- All the above may sound super long but it reality the whole should take Steve and Lisa about 5 minutes each. -->

<p>They both get an email and a notifications on their dashboards.</p>

<p>9 days later, Lisa uploads both the demo and the deliverable to Freelancer Protocol.
Steve received the demo. It looks rather good, so he accepts it.</p>

<p>When he does, two things happen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Freelancer protocol sends Lisa the money</li>
  <li>Steve receives the deliverable</li>
</ul>

<p>The milestone is closed ! On to a next one.</p>
