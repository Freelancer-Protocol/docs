        <h2>2. PURPOSE OF PROTOCOL</h2>

        <p>
          <i>
            Section 2 discusses what Protocol does and does not do when
            providing the Site and Site Services and some of your
            responsibilities when using the Site to find or enter into a Service
            Contract with a Freelancer or Client, as detailed below.
          </i>
        </p>

        <p>
          The Site is a marketplace where Clients and Freelancers can identify
          each other and advertise, buy, and sell Freelancer Services online.
          Subject to the Terms of Service, Protocol provides the Site Services
          to Users, including hosting and maintaining the Site and facilitating
          the formation of Service Contracts. When a User enters a Service
          Contract, the User uses the Site to invoice and pay any amounts owed
          under the Service Contract.
        </p>

        <h3>2.1 RELATIONSHIP WITH PROTOCOL</h3>

        <p>
          Protocol merely makes the Site and Site Services available to enable
          Freelancers and Clients to find and transact directly with each other.
          Through the Site and Site Services, Freelancers may be notified of
          Clients that may be seeking the services they offer, and Clients may
          be notified of Freelancers that may offer the services they seek; at
          all times, however, Users are responsible for evaluating and
          determining the suitability of any Project, Client or Freelancer on
          their own. If Users decide to enter into a Service Contract, the
          Service Contract is directly between the Users and Protocol is not a
          party to that Service Contract.
        </p>

        <p>
          You acknowledge, agree, and understand that Protocol is not a party to
          the relationship or any dealings between Client and Freelancer.
          Without limitation, Users are solely responsible for (a) ensuring the
          accuracy and legality of any User Content, (b) determining the
          suitability of other Users for a Service Contract (such as any
          interviews, vetting, background checks, or similar actions), (c)
          negotiating, agreeing to, and executing any terms or conditions of
          Service Contracts, (d) performing Freelancer Services, or (e) paying
          for Service Contracts or Freelancer Services. You further acknowledge,
          agree, and understand that you are solely responsible for assessing
          whether to enter into a Service Contract with another User and for
          verifying any information about another User. Protocol does not make
          any representations about or guarantee the truth or accuracy of any
          Freelancer’s or Client’s listings or other User Content on the Site;
          does not verify any feedback or information provided by Users about
          Freelancers or Clients; and does not vet or otherwise perform
          background checks on Freelancers or Clients. You acknowledge, agree,
          and understand that Protocol does not, in any way, supervise, direct,
          control, or evaluate Freelancers or their work and is not responsible
          for any Project, Project terms or Work Product. Protocol makes no
          representations about and does not guarantee, and you agree not to
          hold Protocol responsible for, the quality, safety, or legality of
          Freelancer Services; the qualifications, background, or identities of
          Users; the ability of Freelancers to deliver Freelancer Services; the
          ability of Clients to pay for Freelancer Services; User Content,
          statements or posts made by Users; or the ability or willingness of a
          Client or Freelancer to actually complete a transaction.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2 TAXES AND BENEFITS</h3>

        <p>
          Freelancer acknowledges and agrees that Freelancer is solely
          responsible (a) for all tax liability associated with payments
          received from Freelancer’s Clients and through Protocol, and that
          Protocol will not withhold any taxes from payments to Freelancer; (b)
          to obtain any liability, health, workers’ compensation, disability,
          unemployment, or other insurance needed, desired, or required by law,
          and that Freelancer is not covered by or eligible for any insurance
          from Protocol; (c) for determining whether Freelancer is required by
          applicable law to issue any particular invoices for the Freelancer
          Fees and for issuing any invoices so required; (d) for determining
          whether Freelancer is required by applicable law to remit to the
          appropriate authorities any value added tax or any other taxes or
          similar charges applicable to the Freelancer Fees and remitting any
          such taxes or charges to the appropriate authorities, as appropriate;
          and (e) if outside of the United States, for determining if Protocol
          is required by applicable law to withhold any amount of the Freelancer
          Fees and for notifying Protocol of any such requirement and
          indemnifying Protocol for any requirement to pay any withholding
          amount to the appropriate authorities (including penalties and
          interest). In the event of an audit of Protocol, Freelancer agrees to
          promptly cooperate with Protocol and provide copies of Freelancer’s
          tax returns and other documents as may be reasonably requested for
          purposes of such audit, including but not limited to records showing
          Freelancer is engaging in an independent business as represented to
          Protocol.
        </p>

        <h2>3 SERVICE CONTRACTS</h2>

        <p>
          If a Client and Freelancer decide to enter into a Service Contract,
          the Service Contract is a contractual relationship directly between
          the Client and Freelancer. Client and Freelancer have complete
          discretion both with regard to whether to enter into a Service
          Contract with each other and with regard to the terms of any Service
          Contract. You acknowledge, agree, and understand that Protocol is not
          a party to any Service Contract, that the formation of a Service
          Contract between Users will not, under any circumstance, create an
          employment or other service relationship between Protocol and any
          Freelancer or a partnership or joint venture between Protocol and any
          User.
        </p>

        <p>
          With respect to any Service Contract, Clients and Freelancers may
          enter into any written agreements that they deem appropriate provided
          that any such agreements do not conflict with, narrow, or expand
          Protocol’s rights and obligations under the Terms of Service. The
          parties to a Service Contract agree to incorporate the Service Terms
          contained in Schedule 2 to this Agreement.
        </p>

        <h2>4 WORKER CLASSIFICATION</h2>

        <p>
          Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or should be construed to
          create a partnership, joint venture, franchisor/franchisee or
          employer-employee relationship between Protocol and a User.
        </p>

        <h2>5 DEMO</h2>

        <p>
          Freelancer shall, in good faith, produce a video of the Work Product
          created through the performance of the Freelancer Services specified
          in a Service Contract between Users (the “Demo”). Freelancer shall
          send such Demo to Client on the date specified in the Service Contract
          (the “Demo Date”).
        </p>

        <p>
          Freelancer agrees and acknowledges that the Demo shall be a true and
          accurate reflection of the Work Product. Freelancer further agrees and
          acknowledges that any mistruth, misrepresentation or material
          inaccuracy in any Demo pursuant to any Service Contract between Users
          on Protocol shall constitute grounds for Protocol, in its sole
          discretion, to permanently close the Freelancer Account.{" "}
        </p>

        <h3>5.1 DEMO REVIEW</h3>

        <p>
          Client agrees to review any Demo sent to Client by Freelancer pursuant
          to any Service Contract between Users in good faith and with reference
          to the Project Description specified in such Service Contract (the
          “Demo Review”). Client agrees and acknowledges that in relation to any
          Demo, it is obliged to complete the Demo Review within three days of
          and including the Demo Date.
        </p>

        <h3>5.2 DEMO ACCEPTANCE EVENT</h3>

        <p>
          If Client, in good faith, is satisfied with the Demo following any
          Demo Review and indicates as such through the messaging service on
          Protocol’s Site, a “Demo Acceptance Event” occurs.
        </p>

        <h3>5.3 DEMO REJECTION EVENT</h3>

        <p>
          If Client, in good faith, is unsatisfied with the Demo following any
          Demo Review and indicates as such through the messaging service on
          Protocol’s Site, a “Demo Rejection Event” occurs.
        </p>

        <h2>6 PAYMENT TERMS</h2>

        <p>
          You acknowledge and agree that any payments due under a Service
          Contract will be paid by Users through Protocol. Client shall
          remunerate Freelancer for Freelancer Services by the sum specified in
          a Service Contract agreed between Users through Protocol (the “Total
          Payment”).
        </p>

        <h3>6.1 Total Payment</h3>

        <p>
          On any Demo Acceptance Event, the Total Payment becomes payable by
          Client to Freelancer. Client shall pay to Freelancer the Total Payment
          within 14 days of, and including, the Demo Acceptance Event.
        </p>

        <h3>6.2 Part Payment</h3>

        <p>
          On any Demo Rejection Event, 33% of the Total Payment (the “Part
          Payment”) becomes payable by Client to Freelancer. Client shall pay to
          Freelancer the Total Payment within 14 days of, and including the Demo
          Rejection Event.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Disputes</h2>

        <p>
          If a dispute arises between you and Protocol, you and the Protocol
          agree to first attempt to resolve any dispute or claim that arises out
          of this Agreement, the other Terms of Service, your relationship with
          Protocol, the termination of your relationship with Protocol through
          mediation.
        </p>

        <p>
          You and Protocol agree to share the costs of the mediation. Each party
          agrees to cooperate with the mediator and to try to reach a mutually
          satisfactory compromise. If the dispute is not resolved in 30 days
          after one party notifies the other in writing of its desire for
          mediation, either party may take the matter to court.
        </p>

        <h2>8. NON-CIRCUMVENTION</h2>

        <h3>8.1 PAYMENT THROUGH THE PROTOCOL</h3>

        <p>
          Users acknowledge and agree to use the Site as their exclusive method
          for requesting, making and receiving all payments for a Project that
          is subject to a Service Contract. Users further agree to notify
          Protocol if a User suggests to you making or receiving payments
          outside of the Site in violation of this Section 7.1.
        </p>

        <h3>8.2 COMMUNICATION AND FILE TRANSFER THROUGH THE PROTOCOL</h3>

        <p>
          Users acknowledge and agree to use the Site as their exclusive method
          for all communications and transmission of files that relate to a
          Project, including the transfer to a Client by a Freelancer of a Demo
          and Work Product.
        </p>

        <h2>9 TERMINATION</h2>

        <p>
          Unless both you and Protocol expressly agree otherwise in writing,
          either of us may terminate this Agreement in our sole discretion, at
          any time, without explanation, upon written notice to the other, which
          will result in the termination of the other Terms of Service as well,
          except as otherwise provided herein. Protocol is not a party to any
          Service Contract between Users. Consequently, User understands and
          acknowledges that termination of this Agreement (or attempt to
          terminate this Agreement) does not terminate or otherwise impact any
          Service Contract or Project entered into between Users.
        </p>

        <h2> 10 GENERAL</h2>

        <p>
          <i>
            Section 10 discusses additional terms of the agreement between you
            and Protocol, including that the Terms of Service contain our full
            agreement, how the agreement will be interpreted and applied, and
            your agreement not to access the Site from certain locations, as
            detailed below.
          </i>
        </p>

        <h3>10.1 ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h3>

        <p>
          This Agreement, together with the Service Contract Terms and any other
          Terms of Service that the Protocol may, from time to time, incorporate
          by reference into this Agreement, sets forth the entire agreement and
          understanding between you and Protocol relating to the subject matter
          hereof and thereof and cancels and supersedes any prior or
          contemporaneous discussions, agreements, representations, warranties,
          and other communications between you and us, written or oral, to the
          extent they relate in any way to the subject matter hereof and
          thereof. The section headings in the Terms of Service are included for
          ease of reference only and have no binding effect.
        </p>

        <h3>10.2 MODIFICATIONS</h3>

        <p>
          No modification or amendment to the Terms of Service will be binding
          upon Protocol unless in a written instrument signed by a duly
          authorised representative of Protocol or posted on the Site by
          Protocol. Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others
          does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar
          breaches. We do not guarantee we will take action against all breaches
          of this User Agreement.
        </p>

        <h3>10.3 SEVERABILITY</h3>

        <p>
          If and to the extent any provision of this Agreement or the other
          Terms of Service is held to be invalid or unenforceable in whole or in
          part, all other provisions will nevertheless continue to be valid and
          enforceable with the invalid or unenforceable parts severed from the
          remainder of this Agreement and the other Terms of Service.
        </p>

        <h3>10.4 FORCE MAJEURE</h3>

        <p>
          The parties to this Agreement will not be responsible for the failure
          to perform or any delay in performance of any obligation hereunder for
          a reasonable period due to accidents, fires, floods,
          telecommunications or Internet failures, strikes, wars, riots,
          rebellions, blockades, acts of government, governmental requirements
          and regulations or restrictions imposed by law or any other similar
          conditions beyond the reasonable control of such party.
        </p>

        <h2>Schedule 1 - Service Terms</h2>

        <p>
          Users who enter into a Service Contract on the Site with another User
          are bound by these Service Terms in whole. The Protocol is not a party
          to any Service Contract between Users that incorporates these Service
          Terms. These Service Terms, together with the User Agreement, the
          Milestone Agreement and any further agreements that Protocol may, from
          time to time, incorporate by reference into the Terms and Conditions
          form the Terms of Service.
        </p>

        <p>
          By agreeing to these Service Terms, Users do not limit their ability
          to negotiate and determine the specific terms of the Project, except
          as expressly stated otherwise in these Service Terms.
        </p>

        <h3>1. PARTIES</h3>

        <p>
          Client and Freelancer identified on the Site in relation to the
          Project are the parties to the Service Contract. The address of each
          party is the address entered under the tax information on the Site.
          Protocol is not a party to the Service Contract.
        </p>

        <h3>2. SERVICES</h3>

        <p>
          Client and Freelancer agree that the Freelancer is performing services
          as an independent contractor and that Freelancer is not an employee or
          agent of Client. Freelancer will perform the Freelancer Services in a
          professional manner and will timely deliver any agreed upon Work
          Product. The manner and means of performing the Freelancer Services

          third-party, including without limitation any obligation that the Work
          Product or Client software combined with, derived from, or distributed
