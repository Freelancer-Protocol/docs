### What are projects and milestones?

A project is between a single freelancer and client, and is divided into intermediary steps we call milestones.

Each milestone has:

- a **deliverable** (the work the freelancer has to submit)
- a **deadline** (when they have to submit it for)
- a **price** (how much they will get paid for it)

ðŸ‘‰ Milestones take place once after the other within a project and cannot overlap.

<!-- ### Can I cancel or edit a milestone or project? -->

<!-- Both parties can cancel a whole project or any of its milestones before they start. A freelancer can override a project that hasn't been accepted yet.

If the project has already been accepted, the freelancer has to send a request for change his client will have to accept. -->

<!-- ### Why do you hold funds?

Only way to guaranty:

-

It enables gradual commitment on both sides. At any given point, both parties are only committed as far as the current milestone goes,

Just risking as much as the current ongoing milestone. Each side is only committed as far.
Client and freelancer do not -->
