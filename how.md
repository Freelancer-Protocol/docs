## How it works

### Projects and Milestones

A project has one client and one freelancer, and is divided into milestones. Each milestones has its own associated deliverable, price and deadline.

 <!-- The project is divided into one or more milestones.
Each milestone  -->

### Lifecyle of a milestone

A milestone start when both parties agree on its terms. The client is charged right away by the platform.

> üëâ For this reason, the milestone can't start until the client has entered their payment info.

#### If parties agreed on having a demo stage (**recommended**)

The freelancer uploads a demo of the deliverable. The client then has to either accept or reject the demo:

- If the <span class="demo-accepted"> demo is accepted</span>, and given the freelancer uploads the deliverable before the milestone deadline, the freelancer will receive full funds and the client will receive the deliverable.

- If the <span class="demo-rejected"> demo is rejected</span>, the freelancer will only receive an amount corresponding to a third of the milestone price and the client will not receive any deliverable.

#### If parties agreed on skipping the demo stage

As soon as the freelancer uploads the deliverable, the freelancer receives the money and the freelancer receives the deliverable.

Note that during a milestone lifetime, anyone of the two parties can request a modification to the milestone. The changes will have to be accepted by the other party in order to become effective.

## If things go south

### 1. If the client rejects the demo

Only a third of the agreed sum for the milestone is paid to the freelancer. The rest is paid back to the client.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è A client who repeatedly rejects demos that follow their own instructions (outlined in the milestone description and enclosed designs) is facing exclusion from the platform.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è In the same way, a freelancer who uploads misleading demos of deliverables also faces exclusion.

### 2. If the freelancer is late

If both the demo and the deliverable are not uploaded by the milestone deadline, the client is free to either:

- cancel the milestone and get the entire sum back
- extend the milestone by assigning it a new deadline

  > ‚è± The client can charge late fees by changing the milestone amount, but the freelancer will have to agree to those new terms.
