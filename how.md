## How it works

### Projects and Milestones

A project has one client and one freelancer, and is divided into milestones. Each milestones has its own associated deliverable, price and deadline.

 <!-- The project is divided into one or more milestones.
Each milestone  -->

### Lifecyle of a milestone

1. A milestone start when both parties agree on its terms. The client is charged right away by the platform.

   > üëâ For this reason, the milestone can't start until the client has entered their payment info.

2. The freelancer uploads a demo that the client has to accept for the milestone to go on. If it does, the freelancer will have to upload the deliverable before the milestone deadline.

3. If the client accepts the demo, he receives the deliverable and the freelancer receives the money.

Note that during a milestone lifetime, anyone of the two parties can request a modification to the milestone. The changes will have to be accepted by the other party in order to become effective.

## If things go south

### 1. If the client rejects the demo

Only a third of the agreed sum for the milestone is paid to the freelancer. The rest is paid back to the client.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è A client who repeatedly rejects demos that follow their own instructions (outlined in the milestone description and enclosed designs) is facing exclusion from the platform.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è In the same way, a freelancer who uploads misleading demos of deliverables also faces exclusion.

### 2. If the freelancer is late

If both the demo and the deliverable are not uploaded by the milestone deadline, the client is free to either:

- cancel the milestone and get the entire sum back
- extend the milestone by assigning it a new deadline

  > ‚è± The client can charge late fees by changing the milestone amount, but the freelancer will have to agree to those new terms.
