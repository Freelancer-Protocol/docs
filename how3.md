### Can I edit or cancel milestones?

**Before it's been accepted**  
The freelancer can single-handedly override a milestone (edit) or cancel it.

**Whan it's been accepted, before it has started**  
Both parties can cancel the milestone.

**Once the milestone has started**  
The freelancer can send his client a request for change. The new milestone will only take over the existing one if the client accepts it.
