## How is Freelancer Protocol useful to me as a client?

**Control the risk by committing gradually**  
 Freelancer projects get expensive, and it's usually risky to pay in one or two times. We enable you to break the project down into several smaller milestones.

**Have your tasks delivered on time**  
 You're free to cancel the project and get your money back if the freelancer hasn't uploaded anything by the deadline.

You can also change the scope of the project, for exemple to charge late fees (freelancer will need to accept your new terms).
