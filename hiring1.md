title: What if I'm not happy with the deliverable
---

### Do I get a refund if I'm not happy with the deliverable?

No, that's why it is important to be aware of the following guidelines:

⚠️ You never commit more that the amount of the current milestone, so start with small milestones if it's your first time working with a freelancer.

If you're unhappy with a deliverable, you do have the option to 'report this deliverable', and we'll look into it.
Note we can only investigate if the deliverable was accurately described to start with, so:

⚠️ Only accept milestones that accurately describe what the deliverable should be, through the description and attachements.

We reserve the full right to exclude any freelancer whose deliverable consistently get reported and differ from their description.

### I don't have a freelancer. Can you help me find one?

We can try! We interact with different types of freelancers on a daily basis, so send us an email at hello@freelancerprotocol.com and we'll try do our best.

### Do you store my credit card information?

No. We use Stripe for payments and your payment info is never stored on our servers.
