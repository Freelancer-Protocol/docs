## How it all works

### What are projects and milestones?

A project is between a single freelancer and client.
Projects are divided into intermediary steps we call milestones.
Each milestones has a **deliverable** (the work the freelancer has to submit), a **deadline** (when they have to submit it for) and **price** (how much they will get for it).

üëâ Milestones take place once after the other within a project and cannot overlap.

### How do payments get made?

Clients get charged and freelancers get paid throughout a project.

1. We charge the client at the start of each milestone.
2. Funds get transfered to the freelancer when they upload the deliverable.
3. We refund the client in full if the freelancer hasn't uploaded the deliverable by the deadline.

### Why this mechanism?

1. To enable gradual commitment (of time for the freelancer and money for the client)
2. So that the freelancer is paid on time and with 100% certainty
3. So that the client knows they will only pay if the deliverable is sent on time

<!-- ### Why do you hold funds?

Only way to guaranty:

-

It enables gradual commitment on both sides. At any given point, both parties are only committed as far as the current milestone goes,

Just risking as much as the current ongoing milestone. Each side is only committed as far.

### Why should I use Freelancer Protocol?

For two main reasons:

- **gradually commit and control risk**: freelancer project can be expensive, and it's risky to pay in one or two times. We enable you to break the project down into several smaller milestones.
- **get your work on time**: no more waiting for deliverables. You're free to cancel the project if the freelancer hasn't uploaded anything by the deadline. You can also change the scope of the project, for exemple to charge late fees (freelancer will need to accept the new terms).

### Do I get a refund if I'm not happy with the deliverable?

No, that's why it is important to be aware of the following guidelines:

‚ö†Ô∏è Start with small milestones if it's your first time working with a freelancer.

You do have the option to 'report this deliverable', and we'll look into it. Note we can only investigate if the deliverable was accurately described to start with.

‚ö†Ô∏è Only accept milestones that accurately describe what the deliverable should be, through the description and attachements.

We reserve the full right to exclude freelancer whose deliverable consistently get reported and differ from their description.

<!-- > In the same way, a freelancer who uploads misleading demos of deliverables also faces exclusion. -->

<!-- We can only investigate a complaint if the milestone was properly describe to start with.

To help us look into complaints, please make sure
When you do, we'll investigate and reserve the right to exclude any freelancer that consistently upload deliverables like this.

We can only take measure.

How big should I make the milestones ?
Depends on the kind of type of work, but usually 4-5 hours of freelancer's work is a minimum to start with.

### Do you store my credit card information?

We can try!

### Why do I pay in advance ?

We do take money from you before you get the deliverable. This is to be able to guaranty the freelancer you do have the funds and that they'll get paid straight away.
