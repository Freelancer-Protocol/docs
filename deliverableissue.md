### What if I'm not happy with the deliverable?

**We strongly encourage you to use the _report this deliverable_ option (or to [send us an email](mailto:hello@freelancerprotocol.com) ) , and we'll investigate.**

⚠️ Note we can only do this if the deliverable was accurately described to start with, so make sure you only accept milestones that accurately describe what the deliverable should be, through the description and attachements.

We reserve the full right to exclude any freelancer whose deliverables consistently get reported and differ from their description.

### Do I get a refund?

No, that's why it is important to be aware of the following guidelines:

⚠️ Start with small milestones if it's your first time working with a freelancer.

Remember you're never commited to more than the current milestone amount.
