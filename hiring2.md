title: What if I'm not happy with the deliverable?

### Do I get a refund if I'm not happy with the deliverable?

No, that's why it is important to be aware of the following guidelines:

⚠️ Start with small milestones if it's your first time working with a freelancer.

Remember you're never commited to more than the current milestone amount.

**If you're unhappy with a deliverable, we strongly encourage you user the _report this deliverable_ option, and we'll look into it.**

Note we can only investigate if the deliverable was accurately described to start with, so please:

⚠️ Only accept milestones that accurately describe what the deliverable should be, through the description and attachements.

We reserve the full right to exclude any freelancer whose deliverables consistently get reported and differ from their description.
